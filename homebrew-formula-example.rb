      To use zsh-ai-assist with zsh, add this to your ~/.zshrc:
        source #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/zsh/site-functions/zsh-ai-assist.plugin.zsh

      To use with oh-my-zsh, create a custom plugin:
        mkdir -p $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-ai-assist
        ln -sf #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/zsh/site-functions/zsh-ai-assist.plugin.zsh $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-ai-assist/
        
      Then add 'zsh-ai-assist' to your plugins array in ~/.zshrc

      Don't forget to set your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:
        export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
